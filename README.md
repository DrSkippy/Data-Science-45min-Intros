# Data Science 45-min Intros

~45-minute lessons and tutorials on topics that help our data team ([@Gnip](http://gnip.com)) learn new things and become more efficient in our day-to-day work: basic programming, language-specific packages, statistics, machine learning topics, whatever helps! 

For each session, someone puts together the lesson/walk-through and leads the discussion. Presentation platform can include IPython notebooks, interactive code sessions, or anything else. *The more hands-on, the better.*

Feel free to use these for your own (or your team's) growth, and do submit pull requests if you have something to add!
